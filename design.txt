'fluid' categories with unpredictable expenses, like groceries
	If I go over the allocation, show only the total amount spent, with $0 allocated and N/A remaining

'goal' categories with a due_amount and optional due_date
	Later introduce notion of recurring goal categories
	When I record transactions in the goal category that add up to exactly the total amount, 'archive' the category

Show amount spent in (fluid?) categories over the last 4 weeks
For goal categories with due dates: am I on track? (that is, is the amount of money allocated as a fraction of the total due equal to or greater than the amount of time passed as a fraction of the time to pay?)

At the top of the budget page, show:
UNALLOCATED	ALLOCATED	TOTAL AVAILABLE
