'fluid' categories with unpredictable expenses, like groceries
'recurring' categories with repeating or manual due dates, like rent
'one-time' categories with a goal, which may or may not have a due date
Show amount spent in (fluid?) categories this month... instead of month, last 4 weeks? 31 days?
Have some notion of "on track" for recurring categories
How much time is there until the due date?
What is the most reasonable chunk of time to subdivide? (e.g., car insurance is every 6 months -- allocate monthly until it's a month away. Rent is monthly -- allocate weekly)
For recurring categories: am I on track? (that is, is the amount of money allocated as a fraction of the total due equal to or greater than the amount of time passed as a fraction of the time to pay?)
